description: The fascination that others have with my diet.

People often ask m— Jamie, stop.

Sorry. Yes, I agree, in the majority of cases this phrase is used less to portray something that happened, and more to set up a following argument.

But I'm actually writing this one because people _do_ ask me about my diet. If it comes from a place of genuine curiosity, that's fine! This is a choice, and I'm happy to discuss my choice. More often, though, it doesn't, and sadly it most commonly comes tinged with preconceived, negative ideas about who I am. I suppose it doesn't help that I live in an area somewhat outside of civilisation.

Let me first state, though, that I've never been loud about my diet. I am not the straw-man, holier-than-thou preacher whom I've heard a lot about but never had the displeasure of meeting. The only reason the topic comes up at all is because it can make eating with friends a bit more complicated for me, which is the one thing I dislike about it. And if you're staying with or eating with friends often, then it might come up often.

## Childhood

I've been vegetarian since I was about seven years old.

As you might suspect, this wasn't a choice I consciously made so much as one made for me. My sister, who was twice my age, had decided she didn't want to eat animals any more. I can't speak for my mother, but from my perspective she went along with the idea and started making vegetarian meals. My dad wasn't living with us any more, which likely made it all a bit easier. I was told that I could choose to eat what they ate, or my mom would cook me meat and fish if I wanted.

I remember feeling wholly indifferent about it so I went along with what they were doing. I was seven, so I don't remember very much other than that indifference.

At some point, I had stamped myself "vegetarian." I would not eat meat or fish when out and about or at friends' houses. Certainly, my family — and particularly my sister — pushed their beliefs on me, primarily that meat and fish were disgusting. I won't pretend that I came to these conclusions independently, although in their defence I know they did their best not to influence me.

I can't remember a time when I didn't flip to the back of a package to check if it contained anything not-vegetarian before choosing to consume it.

## Growing Up

As I grew older, I did question why I chose not to eat these things that were so normal to others. When I moved out and had all the freedom in the world to eat what I'd want, I questioned it a little more. Why did I not eat meat?

One thing that people don't understand, though, is that I have absolutely zero desire to partake. Meat does not look appetising to me. I do not hunger for it, or feel like I'm missing out in any way. It very genuinely disgusts me in its physicality alone — the look and smell — to speak nothing of how it came to be. There seems to be some idea that I'm depriving myself by abstaining, giving myself a hard time by fighting through the cravings. Not at all.

So for a long time, I just didn't eat this stuff because it disgusted me. Plenty of people don't like Brussels sprouts and don't eat those, and it was sort of like that, just broader.

What didn't make so much sense to me was that I was still flipping food packages over and looking for traces of abstract ingredients that many people don't even know contain animals, like [gelatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin), [rennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet), or [E120 (carmine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine). So abstract that "disgust" didn't really apply.

I was in my late teens at the time, and it didn't take much thought to come up with my reason for being and remaining vegetarian was that I didn't want to contribute to the deaths of animals.

## Meat? Fish? Dairy?

A quick lesson before we continue: vegetarians (which by default refers to _lacto-ovo_ vegetarians) do not eat products that can only be extracted from animals via slaughter, but do consume products produced by animals in ways that don't kill them. I didn't word that very well. A chicken wing is not vegetarian because a chicken dies to produce it[^1]. A chicken egg is vegetarian because hens produce eggs without them needing to die over it.

Some vegetarians don't eat eggs (_ovo_) and some don't consume milk (_lacto_). Some people ([pescetarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarianism) — _not_ vegetarians but often confused[^2]) eat fish but don't eat meat. Vegans ostensibly don't consume _anything_ which was produced with the use of animals.

To be honest, the definitions themselves aren't great, and it only gets more nuanced as we move into veganism. Maybe there are better definitions out there, I don't know. I've never been hardcore into groups or literature around my diet, which I guess gives you a pretty untainted window into the whole thing. So this is all very simplified, but it will serve.

## 2025

In 2025 I took a long, hard look at myself and decided I had to stop eating animal products altogether.

At the start of the year I'd decided it was time I lived more by values that I find important, and being good to animals was one of those. I had long closed my eyes and ears to industries which I knew, on some level, were causing animals to suffer. I always bought the fanciest eggs with the most promises, and I ate cheese sparingly, but I wasn't kidding myself any more.

And so I became a "vegan."

I hated the label. I've never been a fan of labels, and I never much liked the "vegetarian" one, either. I started out by just declining foods that I didn't eat, but that would raise an eyebrow or a question regularly. Then, I thought, perhaps I'll say I eat a "plant-based diet," but that sounds a lot like trying to avoid saying I'm vegan.

And, to be honest, "being vegan" does encompass more than just not eating certain things. I've primarily spoken about food and drink, but both vegetarianism and veganism do mean you have at least some ideas about some things, and might mean you avoid products that have nothing to do with consumption.

So we need labels, and if that means that my "being vegan" gets bundled up with that stereotypical-in-some-universe version of a vegan I mentioned above, then more's the shame for the judge.


## Preach?

There's some idea that we vegans are constantly preaching to others about how awful they are. Perhaps the very idea of that being true made me afraid to say anything. In effect, I now feel embarrassed and apologetic for being the "weird" and "annoying" guy that people have to go out of their way to cater to. There's a lot of social awkwardness on both sides around these things.

I've avoided social events simply so I didn't have to "deal" with the food aspect. As recently as last year I was going to miss out on something that ended up being one of the best times of my life, and that's only because I was talked back into it.

## Why aren't you better?

I've been asked more times than I can count why I eat plants, when they're living things too. And what about fungi? Often it's a joking jab, and sometimes it's genuine curiosity. It's honestly a good question, even though I think most people know inherently that it's _different_. There are probably a whole host of smart answers that I'm not going to tap into in answering it for me.

For me, it comes down to pain and suffering. I try my best to minimise the negative impact I have on others — humans and animals, in this case. Pain and suffering are clearly a negative impact. To my knowledge, plants and fungi neither feel pain nor suffer, and that wraps it up nicely enough for me.

This does put me on a tangent, though. To me, going vegan is about being a better person, but I'm not the best person I could be. I could donate more to charity. I could do more to boycott the billionaires. I could shave my head and dedicate my life entirely to something more important.

But I believe that what you don't do doesn't take away from what you do. There are a million battles to fight, and we can't fight them all. Animal well-being is one of my fights, and I can appreciate it's not everyone's.

Want to help? Do a little. Eat meat-free one day a week, or don't buy the leather this time. It's not a competition.

Taking that back to why I eat plants and fungi? I care about me more than them, and I've got to eat something.

Fuck mosquitoes, though. They can go to hell.

## Health

I'm not a dietician, a doctor, or anything resembling an expert in this field. **That doesn't stop people from having strong opinions on things they don't understand** but it will stop me from writing a bunch about it.

My understanding is that vegans are fine. The usual advice of "eat a variety of different food" and general moderation of stuff you know is a luxury goes. We also need a few supplements, as there are some things we indeed cannot get through normal means — unless, for example, you happen to eat a bunch of seaweed.

My take is that we have supplements, so I take supplements. Problem solved. We're not in the dark ages. That chicken didn't look anything like that 50 years ago, so don't get started on what's "natural".

It doesn't help that I've always been a small, scrawny guy. I'm confident this isn't because of my diet so much as I'm a lazy son-of-a-bitch from a family that, too, is small and scrawny. But it doesn't make my point easier to make.

## Cooking

Thanks in no small part to vegetarianism, my mother prepared wonderful dishes for us throughout my childhood. She told me that it really expanded her world in cooking.

Growing up, she ate meat and potatoes like the rest of the working-class Englanders did at the time. She wasn't a fancy cook. And then she suddenly had to find ways to get her kids the nutrients they needed _without_ meat or fish. She has tried her hand at quite possibly every cuisine in existence, and I had a great time helping and learning from her when I was little.

I'm confident I like trying new things so much because of all that experimentation.

Anyway, I'm a decent cook now. And with the internet, with YouTube, with all the resources we have out there? Cooking vegan is easy.

## Lab-grown Meat

[Cultured meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_meat) is becoming a thing. It's already a thing, but it's currently prohibitively expensive.

What do I think? Great! If we can manufacture meat without animals suffering, everybody wins.

Will I eat it? No. I told you, I have no desire to. But not eating it doesn't mean I disapprove.

## Shit I've heard

I've heard it all over the years. Here are some common favourites that are as original and cunning as they were when I heard them over thirty years ago.

- I'll just eat extra meat for you, then.
- So you just eat vegetables?
- Like a rabbit?
- Meat is manly.
- But we _need_ meat!
- Oh but you don't know what you're missing!
- It's so tasty!

[^1]: "Well, ackshualllyyyy..." Yeah yeah I don't care.

[^2]: I sound mad, and I am. But not because I'm gate-keeping, but because I've been offered fish so damn often because pescetarians are misusing terms!
