Here we are at "Moanings".

I've been writing bits and pieces on the web for as long as I can remember. Most of the older stuff is gone now, and the writing I focus on over at [my main site](https://schembri.me) is professional (or so I try).

I am by no means well known, but there are a few people who keep up with what I write. This put me in a bit of a dilemma: would I be burdening my audience by writing whatever pops into my head when they're there for the software posts? Yes, I decided. And so this place was born.

The idea for this place is really just somewhere to dump a thought out of my head so that it stops nagging at me. I often have these half-fleshed ideas that I'd like to explore in some writing, or just some random thoughts that I think might be worth putting out there. Now I have a place to do that.

While it's public, I'm not trying to build an audience here. Read at your own peril. Or don't! Which was also a nice opportunity to go as barebones as possible with the design. Design? What design? HTML, babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy…

Oh yeah, and I wrote a tool just for this purpose. Well, I say "I," but Claude did the work. [Blurt](https://github.com/shkm/blurt)!
